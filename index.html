            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>I enjoy exploring creative worlds through anime, gaming, and sports. Anime is something I can watch anytime, and I like playing video games with friends.
            Right now, most of my gaming time goes into <b>Star Citizen</b>. My favorite meal is steak with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. If I could travel anywhere, I would visit
            Tokyo and Osaka in Japan, as well as Anchorage, Alaska. My friends describe me as a helpful friend they can turn to. I am also very excited to continue building my skills in
            software development to lay a foundation for my future.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Show to Watch on CrunchyRoll</h2>
            <!-- Local image -->
            <img src="img/onepiece.jpg" alt="One Piece Image" width="400">
            <p>This is a picture of the anime called One Piece! This anime put its author, Eiichiro Oda, as the 7th highest-selling author in history. His sales have placed him among
            legendary authors like William Shakespeare.</p>
            <p>This show has been a great watch for me. It gradually became my favorite over the 1100 episodes I watched. I even started to read the manga! This anime is full of hardships, joy, comedy, 
            backstories, character development, world-building, and so much more!</p>

            <p>Along with watching the UFC, I also love to watch golf, college football (Roll Tide!), and NFL football!</p>
